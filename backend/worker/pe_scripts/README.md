# Quick ReadMe for PE!!!

The scripts in this directory are run by the P&E team only.

Scans that start with "pe" initiate these scripts which pull data from
third-party APIs and store the results in the P&E database instance.

Certain scans, such as peDomSync and peHibpSync, pull data from the Crossfeed
database instance and then insert it into the P&E instance.
